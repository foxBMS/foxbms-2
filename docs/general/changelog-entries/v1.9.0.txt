The toolchain installation has been centralized into a prefix.
On Windows the prefix is ``C:\foxbms`` and on Linux it is ``/opt/foxbms``.
This shall help to simplify the toolchain handling and updates in the future.
This means the following tools need to be installed again:
- Ceedling
- Doxygen
- drawio-desktop
- Graphviz
- mingw-w64
- Python environment
- Ruby

Further, TI Code Composer Studio has been updated to ``12.8.1`` and therefore
also needs to be installed.

See :ref:`SOFTWARE_INSTALLATION` on how to install the individual tools.
While this update may cause some inconvenience as tools need to be installed
again, it will make updates and adding new tools much simpler in the future.

foxBMS 2 requires exactly Python3.12.x.
If the development environment has been created with an early version of
Python, the environment needs to be removed an recreated with Python3.12.

Building the documentation now requires drawio.desktop.
See the installation instructions in :ref:`SOFTWARE_INSTALLATION`.

On Windows, foxBMS 2 requires PowerShell (``pwsh.exe``) or bash (``Git Bash``)
as the ``fox.bat`` wrapper has been removed, i.e., use the ``fox.ps1`` or
``fox.sh`` wrapper respectively.

Added
=====

- Support building on Linux.
- Document how to build libraries.
- Add Tdk NTCG163JX103DT1 temperature sensor.
- Add dedicated BMS-Slave configuration file that contains all relevant
  information (``src/app/application/config/bms-slave_cfg.h``).

- Add the following features to ``fox.py``:

  - ``etl``
  - ``plot``
  - ``log``
  - ``bms``

  Run ``-h`` on each command to see detailed options.

- Add a CAN 'DebugResponse' message for the current uptime of the
  foxBMS system.
- Add boot timestamp to the debug message.
- Add a flag to indicate if a request was made to set the RTC time
  and return whether it was a valid or invalid request.
- Add a ``pre-commit`` script to ``.git/hooks`` specific to foxBMS needs when
  a project is developed within a git repository.
  This script is generated automatically.
- Add typechecking through mypy for ``fox CLI`` .
- Check whether ``MATLAB®`` is available or not when configuring the project.
- Add ``FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP`` Library to the os path.
- Add verbosity option to ``cli-unittest`` subcommand.

  - The example used invalid build commands.
  - The example did not exit on build errors.
- Fix return value of function ``run_script_tests``
