|foxbms| updated to TI ARM CGT 20.2.5.LTS.
Installation instructions are found at :numref:`css_install`.

|foxbms| updated to LLVM 13.0.0.
Installation instructions are found in the LLVM section.

Added
=====

- The new default compiler set in ``conf/env/paths_win32.txt`` and
  ``conf/env/paths_linux.txt`` is now TI ARM CGT v20.2.5.LTS (shipped with CCS
  ``11.0.0``).
- Add support for the environment variable ``FOXBMS_2_CCS_VERSION_STRICT`` to
  check for the exact CCS version.
- Added hardware specifications for the LTC based slaves to the documentation.
- Added a superimposed state machine for all insulation monitoring device
  drivers to control the subordinate, device specific driver implementations.
- Added driver implementation for Bender IR155 insulation monitoring device.
- Transmit the unique ID of the MCU on which |foxbms| is running on startup
  via CAN.
- Added a mechanism to the ``algorithm`` module that allows to reinitialize an
  algorithm.
- Added an API to the ``MCU`` module that allows to measure microseconds with
  the ``RTI`` module.
- Added a can helper that transforms a boolean to an integer value (fitting to
  the CAN messages).
- The Axivion configuration has been updated to ``7.2.3`` in the release
  ``1.1.2``, however the version setting in the configuration file has not.
  The versions of the Axivion Suite and the configuration files have been
  aligned to ``7.2.3``.
- Added the version information to the header section of all ``C`` source and
  header files.
- Added a function to compute CRCs with the MCU hardware.
- The ``FRAM`` module now writes a CRC of the data written to the FRAM. It
  also reads the stored CRC and compares it with the CRC calculated on the
  read data. This makes FRAM entries existing prior to this version invalid.
- A ``DIAG`` entry was added for FRAM errors.
- Added documentation for the ``FRAM`` and the ``CRC`` modules.
- Integrated interaction with the diagnostic module into the Maxim ``AFE``
  driver.
- Added information on debug adapters to the documentation.
- Documented the rule that pointer parameters to functions must indicate in
  their Doxygen documentation whether they are used as input, output or both.
- Added a continuously running task with same priority as the 1ms task.
  It is suspended by default if unused.
- Added documentation on the Maxim driver.

Changed
=======

- The linker step now uses ``--start-group`` and ``--end-group`` to re-read
  libraries until all symbols are resolved instead of ``--reread_libs``.
  This change simplifies the integration of the build into Axivion.
- FreeRTOS configuration is now validated in
  ``os_freertos_config-validation.h``.
- Updated the documentation of the of the LTC-based interface |ltc-ltc6820|
  version 1.0.3 (see :ref:`INTERFACE_LTC_6820___V1_0_3__`).
- Updated LLVM to version 13.0.0.
- Updated the pinout documentation for the |bms-master| version 1.1.1
  (see :ref:`MASTER_TMS570___V1_1_1__`).
- Update the static code analysis to Axivion 7.4.0.
- Increased the size of the variable that describes stack sizes for FreeRTOS,
  allowing for the fully supported stack size of the port.
- The diagnosis entries for the ``LTC`` module have been renamed in order to
  reflect that they are relevant for all ``AFE`` implementations.
- The schema file for the ``bms.json`` configuration file has been split into
  several files for readability and Visual Studio Code has been made aware of
  the schema.
- Added a style check that constant values should be on the right hand side of
  a comparison.
- Updated FreeRTOS to version 10.4.5 (from 10.4.3).
- Cleaned up the CAN callback for receiving commands.
- Extended the script for updating the doxygen headers in source files so that
  it fetches first and then compares to the tracking branch.
- Updated the documentation of the system monitoring module and implemented
  the recording of violations to the persistent memory.
- Split the definition of CAN callback functions into separate definitions for
  received and transmitted messages in order to better reflect the actual
  implementation and prevent wrong usage.
- Number of strings now configured to one by default.
- Renamed the ``FRAM`` functions to adhere to *verb-noun* style.
- Extended the Axivion configuration so that parameters without an assertion
  can be suppressed.
- The threshold above which balancing is started for a single cell has been
  made configurable by the |foxbms| CAN messages that are already defined.
- MCU specific defines have been moved from ``general.h`` to ``mcu.h``.
- The static assert macro ``static_assert`` has been renamed to
  ``f_static_assert`` to work around compiler limitations.
- The following defines have been renamed to be aligned with
  :ref:`NAMING_CONVENTIONS`:

  - ``BS_NR_OF_MODULES`` to ``BS_NR_OF_MODULES_PER_STRING``,
  - ``BS_NR_OF_CELLS_PER_MODULE`` to ``BS_NR_OF_CELL_BLOCKS_PER_MODULE`` and
  - ``BS_NR_OF_BAT_CELLS`` to ``BS_NR_OF_CELL_BLOCKS_PER_STRING``.
- Loop correctly over ``BS_NR_OF_MODULES_PER_STRING``,
  ``BS_NR_OF_CELL_BLOCKS_PER_MODULE`` and ``BS_NR_OF_CELL_BLOCKS_PER_STRING``.

- Function names are now checked by Axivion to conform to the guidelines.
- Improved the MISRA-C conformance of of the database module
  (:ref:`DATABASE_MODULE`).
- Fixed the pack current check in ``SOA_CheckCurrent``.
- Fixed LLVM install script to check for permissions before running the script.

Deprecated
==========

Removed
=======

- Removed unused function ``OS_SystemTickHandler()``.
- The Cppcheck support and its configuration files as well as the respective
  build and clean commands have been removed.
  The static program analysis of the embedded software is done by Axivion
  Bauhaus Suite (see :ref:`AXIVION_BAUHAUS_SUITE`).

Fixed
=====

- Fixed a bug where the ``update_doxygen_header.py`` script tried to
  ``git add`` files that did not exist.
- The HALCoGen SPI interface chip select configuration is overwritten and all
  hardware chip selects are disabled when using a software chip select.
  This causes all SPI communication using hardware chip selects to fail for
  this SPI interface.
  Now the SPI chip select register are correctly configured before starting a
  SPI transaction.
- Suppress a superfluous warning during unit test builds concerning the number
  of bytes per word (as this information is used for task sizing).
- Fixed "unsafe" macros that had not parentheses and added this violation to
  violations that fail the CI.
- Fixed undesired attempt of installation of git hooks even when the project
  was not stored in a git repository.
- Fixed import order in Python files.
- Fixed a static assertion in the Maxim driver (that prevented in some
  constellations compilation due to a logic error).
- Fixed a timing violation in the Maxim driver (a computationally costly
  operation has been moved out of the 1ms-task).
- Some defines where invisible to the preprocessor due to missing includes.
  This has been resolved and measures taken that this situation cannot return.
- The HALCoGen generated startup file ``HL_sys_startup.c`` does not need to be
  compiled as |foxbms| implements the startup in ``fstartup.c``.
