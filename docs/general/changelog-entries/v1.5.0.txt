Added
=====

- Added hardware design files (e.g., schematics, layout, BOM and STEP file
  etc.) for the NXP MC33775A monitoring IC.
- Added driver for the PCF2131 RTC.
  The driver uses I2C to communicate with the IC.
- A basic GUI to interact with the |foxbms| via CAN from a PC.
- The software version and the die ID can be requested via CAN.
- The FRAM can now be initialized/reinitialized via CAN.
- Stub code for the software reset via CAN has been implemented.
- The precharge abort reason (voltage or current) is now evaluated and the
  result is transmitted via CAN.
- Now CAN messages with extended identifier can be transmitted and received.
  Four CAN mailboxes (61-63) are reserved for the reception of messages with
  extended identifiers on each CAN.
  The HALCoGen configuration for these mailboxes is overwritten during the
  initialization phase.
- The I2C driver API was reworked.
  There are now three types of communication:
  read, write and write followed by repeated start followed by read.
- The I2C communication now uses DMA and is made in a separate task.
- Basic documentation of defines that can be used to define the application
  behavior.

Changed
=======

- The default interface configuration for BMS-Slaves is the interface 1 on the
  |bms-interface|\ s:

  - for LTC-based interfaces: hardware chip select 1 on SPI 1
  - for NXP-based interfaces: hardware chip select 1 on SPI 1

- The chip select configuration has been unified.
  The previous implementation worked like this:

  - for software chip select the SPI configuration has been
    configured directly in the configuration struct by setting the member
    ``csPin`` to a certain pin and the member ``csType`` to
    ``SPI_CHIP_SELECT_SOFTWARE``in a variable of type
    ``SPI_INTERFACE_CONFIG_s``.
  - For hardware chip select, i.e., ``csType`` set to
    ``SPI_CHIP_SELECT_HARDWARE``, the configuration in ``csPin`` was ignored,
    and the pin configuration in the member ``pConfig`` was evaluated.

  Now, the SPI configuration is done by setting the chip select type via the
  member ``csType`` and the pin to be used via the member ``csPin`` in a
  variable of type ``SPI_INTERFACE_CONFIG_s``.
  Therefore there is no need anymore the adapt the ``spiDAT1_t`` configuration,
  when another chip select should be used.
- The members in `DATA_BLOCK_ERROR_STATE_s` have been renamed to better reflect
  what each entry actually indicates.
- The type of all members in `DATA_BLOCK_ERROR_STATE_s` have been changed to
  `bool`.
- The order of members in `DATA_BLOCK_ERROR_STATE_s` has been changed, so that
  the entries are logically grouped.
  This change is transparent, as long as the application does **not** relay on
  the memory layout.
- Changed data type for error flags in database entries to boolean.
- Applied the *include-what-you-use* paradigm to the |foxbms| sources.
  The :ref:`C_CODING_GUIDELINES` have been adapted accordingly and generally
  been improved.
- Added dedicated enum for error flags to .dbc respectively .sym file.
- Rewrote the CRC implementation for the LTC ICs from scratch and added
  unit tests for the new implementation.
- Update the static code analysis to Axivion 7.5.0 (from 7.4.6).
- Software version is now also saved in FRAM version struct. As this is The
  the first FRAM entry, this changes the memory layout and makes FRAM entries
  existing prior to this version invalid.
- A successful boot is now indicated via CAN by sending

  - the magic start sequence,
  - the software version information,
  - the MCU die ID,
  - the MCU lot number,
  - the MCU wafer number and
  - the magic end sequence.

  See ``src/app/engine/config/sys_cfg.c`` for implementation details.

- Updated the documentation section about Lauterbach debug probes.
- Removed define ``BS_MAX_SUPPORTED_CELLS`` from file ``battery_system_cfg.h``
  and moved the definition to the individual AFE implementations.
- Use ``float_t`` instead of ``float``.
- Aligned the hardware documentation for BMS-Master, BMS-Interface and
  BMS-Slave (see :ref:`BMS_MASTERS_OVERVIEW`, :ref:`BMS_INTERFACES_OVERVIEW`,
  and :ref:`BMS_SLAVES_OVERVIEW`)
- Updated the documentation section about the |foxbms| platform
- The functionality to switch to user mode is now implemented as an inline
  function instead of a macro.
- The default optimization level is set to -O0 (see
  ``conf/cc/cc-options.yaml``).

Deprecated
==========

Removed
=======

Fixed
=====

- Fixed the hardware readme as it referenced the wrong |foxbms-bms-master|
  version.
- Fixed the regular expression for checking the validity of macro names.
- Fixed wrong configured chip select pin for MCU SBC. Chip select 1 instead of
  chip select 0 was configured.
