This version of |foxbms| bundles with new hardware releases, most importantly
a new |foxbms| |bms-master|.

The |bms-master| version is bumped to ``v1.2.2``.
For details on the |bms-master| see :ref:`TI_TMS570_BASED_BMS_MASTER_V1_2_2`.

The |bms-master| now comes with a streamlined supply concept, which only
requires a single SBC and thereby making the hard- and software simpler.
Details on the SBC configuration, which must be flashed on the SBC prior to PCB
assembly, are found at
:ref:`TI_TMS570_BASED_BMS_MASTER_V1_2_2_FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION`.

Now the CAN1 Enable and Standby signals have been wired directly to the MCU,
instead of using I2C based port expander.
To achieve software compatibility with older |bms-master| releases, see
:ref:`TI_TMS570_BASED_BMS_MASTER_V1_1_1` for details.

Further, new releases for all |bms-slaves| have been added.

This version of |foxbms| also begins to introduced changes that are required
for the bootloader.

.. note::

   All changes with respect to the bootloader do not really implement any
   bootloader functionality, they are made to prepare for the bootloader.
   **This version does not include any bootloader functionality**.

There is a new Python environment ``2025-01-pale-fox``.
This environment contains updates for all packages and adds some new packages,
that are needed for :ref:`FOX_PY`.

.. note::

   In order to update the environment follow the steps documented at
   :ref:`environment_updates`.

Added
=====

- The ``f_BmsState`` message now also transmits the current BMS-substate.
- When the BMS-state or BMS-substate changes a single asynchronous
  ``f_BmsState`` message will be sent.
- Added assertion for correct diagnosis IDs and corresponding unit test cases.
- Added TDK NTCGS103JF103FT8 temperature sensor.
- Bootloader related changes:

  - Add dummy files for the bootloader

    - embedded sources (``src/bootloader/*``),
    - unit test sources (``tests/unit/bootloader/*``),
    - HAL configuration (``conf/hcg/bootloader.*``), and
    - unit test configuration (``conf/unit/bootloader_project_*.yml``).

  - Add bootloader related build commands:

    - ``build_bootloader_embedded``: build the bootloader for the embedded
      target.
    - ``build_bootloader_host_unit_test``: build and run the bootloader unit
      tests.
    - ``build_bootloader_spa``: build the bootloader for the static program
      analysis.
    - ``build_bootloader_doxygen``: build the bootloader's doxygen
      documentation.
    - ``build_bootloader_doxygen_unit_test``: build the bootloader's unit test
      doxygen documentation.

  - |fox-py|: Added the following commands

    - ``check``
    - ``load-app``
    - ``reset``
    - ``run-app``

  - Debugger: Prepared the Lauterbach configuration for the bootloader
    (``tools/debugger/lauterbach/*`` and ``tools/waf-tools/f_lauterbach.py``).
    This is currently a dummy implementation and does not flash an elf file to
    the target.

Changed
=======

- The HAL configuration for the application has been moved from
  ``src/hal`` to ``src/app/hal``.
- Renamed build command for the embedded application build from ``build_bin``
  to ``build_app_embedded``.
- Renamed build command for the static program analysis application build from
  ``build_axivion`` to ``build_app_spa``.
- Renamed build command for the host unit test application build from
  ``build_unit_test`` to ``build_app_host_unit_test``.
- Simplify the changelog file itself (``docs/general/changelog.rst``) and
  changelog processing.
- Replaced ``_Ignore*`` calls by ``_Expect*`` calls inside unit tests.
- Updated the unit test framework ``Ceedling`` to version ``1.0.0-f899db8``.
- Write the version information dynamically when building the documentation
  (version source is the main build script ``wscript`` in the repository root).
- Read the version information dynamically when running the |fox-cli| tool
  (version source is the main build script ``wscript`` in the repository root).
- Make external function declarations of CAN callbacks consistent.
- Move the signal definition CAN messages for the cell temperatures and
  voltages in the respective source files.
- Pinning a specific compiler version does no longer rely on an environment
  variable.
  The pinned compiler version is only defined via ``conf/cc/cc-options.yaml``
  by setting ``FOXBMS_2_CCS_VERSION_STRICT`` to the specific version.
- Files that shall be removed by the Waf-HALCoGen-tool after code was generated
  need to manually specify non-OS files that shall be removed.
- Upgraded FreeRTOS to V10.4.6.
- Improved software architecture description in documentation.
- Improved documentation section for database module.
- Simplified top level build script ``./wscript``.
- The application doxygen build command has been changed to
  ``build_app_doxygen`` (from ``build_doxygen_src``).
- The application's unit test doxygen build command has been changed to
  ``build_app_doxygen_unit_test`` (from ``build_doxygen_tests``).
- The documentation build instructions were moved from the top level build
  script ``./wscript`` to ``docs/wscript``.
- Emphasize the exact version of |mingw-w64| (and therefore GCC) that needs to
  be installed to successfully run the unit test suite.
- The version information is now separated from the application build
  information.
- A dedicated CAN message for the transmission of fatal errors was added.
  Diagnosis  entries with a severity of ``DIAG_FATAL_ERROR`` lead to an opening
  of the contactors.
  This CAN message will be transmitted with a period of 100ms as soon as an
  active fatal error has been detected, until the error is cleared again.
- Added a wrapper for the FreeRTOS software timer.
- Improved cli unit test coverage.

  - the app, i.e., the BMS application, with version and build configuration
    version
  - the bootloader with just the version information.
- Changed CAN1 enable and standby pins from port expander to discrete GPIOs.

  - CAN1 Enable:              PEX2 PIN0 -> N2HET2[18]
  - CAN1 Standby (inverted):  PEX2 PIN1 -> N2HET2[23]

Deprecated
==========

Removed
=======

- Support for the Segger J-Link debug probe and the Segger Ozone debugger
  software have been removed.
  |foxbms| only includes Lauterbach Trace configuration support for debugging.
  However still any JTAG-capable debugger can be used for debugging foxBMS,
  just the automatic configuration is no longer supported.
- The AFE APIs ``AFE_RequestIoWrite`` and ``AFE_RequestIoRead`` have been
  removed as they have not been used.

Fixed
=====

- Invalid flags in the CAN messages ``f_CellVoltages`` and
  ``f_CellTemperatures`` were transmitted inverted (Valid instead of Invalid
  and vice versa).
- Fixed import-order in |fox-cli| tool.
- Fixed typos.
- Fixed unintentional behavior of the ``BMS`` state machine that the contactors
  could be closed after power-cycle without receiving a ``STANDBY`` request.
- Balancing relevant flags are now transmitted correctly via CAN.
  A flag indicating if balancing is currently allowed or not is transmitted in
  message ``f_BmsState``.
  A second flag transmitted in message ``f_StringState`` shows if at least one
  cell is currently being balancing in this string or not.
- Fixed a Python dependency bug when using Python version below v3.11.
- Fixed flags passed to the test compilation step in unit test configuration
  files (``:flags:↳:test:↳:compile:``).
- Fixed unit tests include paths.
- Fixed various READMEs.
- Fixed various documentation rendering issues.
- Fixed most of the Axivion naming check implementation.
- The ``fox.bat``-wrapper did not work when the username contained whitespace.
- Fixed a bug in ``f_vscode.py`` when searching the platform appropriate
  ``fox``-wrapper.
- Fixed various bugs in ``ADES1830`` AFE driver:

  - Invalid flags for cell temperatures were not set correctly.
  - Invalid flags for GPIO measurement values were not set correctly.
  - Diagnosis entry for ``DIAG_ID_AFE_COMMUNICATION_INTEGRITY`` was not called.
  - String and module voltage was previously not measured/calculated.
