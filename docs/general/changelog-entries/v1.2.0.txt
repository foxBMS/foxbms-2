Added
=====

- Added stubs for the Bender IR155 insulation monitoring device driver (i.e.
  **driver is non-functional**).
- Extended the documentation with a render of the architecture against which
  the |foxbms| implementation is checked.
- Added driver for I2C communication for MCU.
- Added driver for I2C port expander.
- Added driver for I2C humidity/temperature sensor.
- Implemented feedback through auxiliary contacts for the contactor driver.
- Debug LED is now toggled depending on system state (slow: okay, fast: error)
- Added an option to install a pre-commit hook in the repository.
  The pre-commit hook runs the guidelines check.
- Added a driver module that allows to use the enhanced PWM features of the
  MCU.
- Adapted CAN module to receive/transmit messages either via CAN1 or CAN2.
- Annotate maximum stack size in |freertos| so that debugger can catch this
  information.
- Updated the hardware design files (e.g., schematics, layout, BOM and STEP
  file etc.) of the |bms-master|  to ``v1.1.1``.
- Added information on citing the project in ``CFF`` format.
- Added driver for interlock.

Changed
=======

- The measurement IC (``MIC``) module has been renamed to Analog Front-End
  (``AFE``).
- ``build_all`` and ``clean_all`` need to run the Axivion related commands as
  last steps.
- The file content of the linker script for the elf file is now hashed using
  Unix-style line endings as this is more robust (e.g., downloaded zip files
  from GitHub releases).
- Sort the SPI formats so that there are no conflicts between the configuration
  on SPI1 and SPI4 (Both are connected to the interface connector).
- Control the pins of the interface for LTC AFEs with the port expander on the
  |foxbms| master board.
- The documentation build defaults now only to ``html`` and ``spelling``,
  .i.e., ``linkcheck`` has been removed.
- Increased stack size of 10ms task to 5120 bytes (from 4096).
- Declared large database entries as static, so that they are placed in the
  data segment to reduce the stack usage of the respective task.

Deprecated
==========

Removed
=======

- Removed unused code in main build script.

Fixed
=====

- Fixed variable name typos in ``moving_average.c``.
- A specific order of build/clean commands related to Axivion build and clean
  commands resulted in build errors.
  Now the build is early aborted if a wrong order is supplied and a
  descriptive error message is printed to stderr.
- The documentation included a wrong statement about how to configure
  |freertos|.
- Battery voltage is now transmitted correctly via CAN (ID: 0x222).
