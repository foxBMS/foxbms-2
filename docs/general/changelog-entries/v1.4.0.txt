Added
=====

- |foxbms| has been certified as open source hardware by the
  Open Source Hardware Association under the
  OSHWA UID `DE000128 <https://certification.oshwa.org/de000128.html>`_.
  This information has been added to the README and license documentation
  (see :ref:`OPEN_SOURCE_HARDWARE_CERTIFICATION`).
- Added Axivion configuration (see ``tests/axivion/addon``) to check for

  - source files to be decodable with a specific encoding
  - POSIX 3.206
  - filename uniqueness in the build process
  - file level doxygen comment
  - doxygen comments for extern and static variables, and typedefs
  - the |foxbms| license header
  - literal suffixes for numerical assignments
- Added test cases for the Axivion rules (see ``tests/axivion/addon-test``)
- The |foxbms| GUI wrapper is now implemented as a module.
- Added a driver for the NXP MC33775A monitoring IC.
  The driver measures cell voltages, cell temperatures via an I2C multiplexer
  and controls cell balancing.

Changed
=======

- Updated the hardware design files (e.g., schematics, layout, BOM and STEP
  file etc.) of the |bms-master|  to ``v1.1.3`` (see
  :ref:`CHANGELOG_FOR_MASTER_TMS570_V1_1_3`).
- Function names are now checked by Axivion to conform to the guidelines.
- Use correct prefix in the

  - ``version`` module (:ref:`VERSION_MODULE`)
  - ``assert`` module (:ref:`ASSERTION_MODULE`)
- The behavior of the ``build_bin`` command, which creates the binary, has been
  improved.
  If the BMS configuration file (``conf/bms/bms.json``) has been changed, the
  project needs to be reconfigured (by running ``waf configure``, see
  :ref:`BUILDING_THE_APPLICATION`).
- The following settings in BMS configuration file (``conf/bms/bms.json``) have
  been changed:

  - The AFE key for the IC has been renamed from ``chip`` to ``ic`` in the
    ``slave-unit/analog-front-end`` section.
  - The balancing strategy has been moved into the ``application`` section.
  - The operating system key has been renamed from ``operating-system`` to
    ``rtos``.
  - The SOF needs to be configured in the
    ``application/algorithm/state-estimation`` section.
    Currently ``"sof": "trapezoid"`` is the only valid option.

- Several variables and functions have been renamed to conform to the |foxbms|
  style guide (:ref:`STYLE_GUIDE`).
  There will be additional changes in future releases as the task of having
  a fully style guide conforming repository is an iterative and timely process.

Deprecated
==========

Removed
=======

Fixed
=====

- The macro ``SOC_STRING_CAPACITY_As`` was incorrectly braced, as it had less
  closing than opening braces
  (``src/app/application/algorithm/state_estimation/soc/counting/soc_counting_cfg.h``).
  This however did not reveal as bug, as the calling function fixed the
  incorrect bracing by adding the missing brace correctly
  (``src/app/application/algorithm/state_estimation/soc/counting/soc_counting.c``).
- The delay between chip select activation and start of SPI transmission and the
  delay between end of SPI transmission and chip select deactivation have been
  increased to avoid SPI transmission errors for AFEs.
- The CAN2 message boxes were not activated within the HALCoGen configuration.
- Fix several unit testing warnings due to a misconfiguration with respect to
  ``BS_NR_OF_STRINGS``.
