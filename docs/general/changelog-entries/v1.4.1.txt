|foxbms| updated to TI ARM CGT 20.2.6.LTS.
Installation instructions are found at :numref:`css_install`.

Added
=====

- The new default compiler set in ``conf/env/paths_win32.txt`` and
  ``conf/env/paths_linux.txt`` is now TI ARM CGT v20.2.6.LTS (shipped with CCS
  ``12.0.0``).
- Added driver for *Murata NCU15XH103F6Sxx* temperature sensor

Changed
=======

- Updated the hardware design files (e.g., schematics, layout, BOM and STEP
  file etc.) of the |bms-master|  to ``v1.1.5`` (see
  :ref:`CHANGELOG_FOR_THE_TI_TMS570_BASED_BMS_MASTER_V1_1_5`).
- Updated documentation of the interface using the |max-max17841b| transceiver
  chip.
- The implementation of the CAN driver has been changed to simplify adding
  new messages.
  Furthermore it is now possible to force a certain style on how CAN messages
  are defined in the symbol/dbc files as well as in the source code.
  For further information see :ref:`HOW_TO_USE_THE_CAN_MODULE`.
- Updated version of ``.sym`` file for the definition of the CAN messages and
  signals to v6.0 (from 5.0).
- Update the static code analysis to Axivion 7.4.6 (from 7.4.0).

Deprecated
==========

Removed
=======

- Unused calculation of MOL, RSL and MSL curves for trapezoid algorithm in
  ``SOF`` module.

Fixed
=====

- In ``ADC`` module, corrected formula making the conversion from raw ADC
  reading to voltage in mV.
- The address of two diagnostic registers in the Smart Power Switch driver
  was wrong.
- Endianness definition throughout the CAN signals was inconsistent. Not all
  signals were correctly defined as big-endian.
