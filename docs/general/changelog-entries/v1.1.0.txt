|foxbms| now defaults to |code-composer-studio| 10.3.1 in order to build
the binaries. If an older version of the compiler should be used, it can be
configured in ``conf/env/paths_win32.txt``. For installation instructions
see :numref:`css_install`.

|foxbms| now ships with a new conda environment ``2021-08-arctic-fox`` and the
local conda environment needs to be updated.

Added
=====

- Diagnosis entries can now be configured specifically for each LTC6813-1
  instance.
- Endianness is now configurable in CAN module.
- Add number of balanced cells in each string to database entry
  ``DATA_BLOCK_ID_BALANCING_CONTROL``.
- Added a built-in self-test for the database module that writes and reads an
  entry during startup of the system.
- Added a helper tool for the maintenance of the list of licenses in the conda
  environment.
- Added a helper macro for the generation of array initializers
  (``REPEAT_U()``).
- Documented how to use Ozone to show the location of a failed assertion.
- Cell voltages and temperatures are each stored in one array containing all
  values. Added database helper functions to get string, module or cell/sensor
  number from index in the global array.
- Added a block diagram of the |foxbms| master hardware.
- Added a SPI API function that allows to switch the functional state (GIO or
  SPI) of a SPI pin of the MCU.
- Added testing for different versions of TI CCS (versions ``10.2.1``,
  ``10.3.0``, ``10.3.1`` and ``10.4.0``).
- Add fallback compiler detection.
- Added a link to foxBMS project website with acknowledgment information:

  - List of funded projects foxBMS has received funding from
  - Instructions on how to reference to |foxbms|

- Added handling of I2C multiplexers to the Maxim monitoring IC driver.
- Added a flash tool to the Waf toolchain. It is based on SEGGER J-Flash and
  can be invoked by calling ``waf install_bin`` or running the ``Flash:Binary``
  task in |code|.
- Added a short note on the installation of PEAK-Drivers (for CAN
  communication) to the installation manual.
- Added a section on testing the setup of the toolchain.
- Added configurable reaction type, delay and severity for each diagnosis
  entry.
- Configuration of failures, that lead to a transition to the error state is
  now done by configuring the severity of the respective diagnosis entry to
  ``DIAG_FATAL_ERROR``. The handling of the timing delay to transition into
  error state is done by the BMS module.
- Implemented CAN messages defined in .dbc file. Only stubs are implemented for
  some CAN messages respectively some signals.
- Documented workarounds that have to be applied to HALCoGen.

Changed
=======

- The schematic of the |bms-master| has been updated (``v1.0.2``).
- The new default compiler set in ``conf/env/paths_win32.txt`` is now
  TI ARM CGT v20.2.4.LTS (shipped with CCS ``10.3.1``).
- Reorganized the compiler tests in ``tests/ccs/*``.
- Updated the development conda environment to ``2021-06-arctic-fox``. Please
  run the ``conda-update-env.bat`` script in order to update your local
  environment.
- CAN callback functions are now defined in separate files to increase
  readability.
- Ring buffer for CAN RX was replaced by a |freertos| queue. A DIAG entry was
  added that detects if the queue is full when trying to add an element.
- Updated the black configuration to match the new python version
  (``Python 3.9.5``).
- Improved the Ozone configuration so that an data breakpoint is set
  automatically on the symbol ``fas_assertLocation.pc``.
- Run VS Code build tasks as process.
- Use posix paths in VS Code configuration on all host platforms.
- Improved the MISRA compliance of the monitoring driver for the family of
  Maxim ICs.
- Pause the terminal when running ``ide.bat``, ``waf.bat`` and ``waf.sh`` in
  case the conda base or development environment could not be found. This is
  done to clearly point the user to the error message.
- Moved the struct storing the version of the software to a fixed location
  (address ``0x003FFF40``) in flash memory.
- Replace all access to registers through the ``IO_`` functions with an access
  that keeps the volatile keyword on the register.
- Dropped the requirement for an internal library (``pyhameg``) in the HIL
  test.
- Updated the unit test framework ``Ceedling`` to version ``0.31.1``.
- Simplified the configuration of the Cppcheck tool.
- Improved several function names in the ``ftask`` module.
- All required Queues are now created in one function (``FTSK_CreateQueues``)
  before the scheduler starts.
- Split the Waf compiler tool into smaller sub-tools to simplify maintenance
  and tests.

Deprecated
==========

Removed
=======

- Completely removed dynamic allocation from |freertos| and reduced the (unused)
  heap size to 0.
- Removed deprecated option ``COLS_IN_ALPHA_INDEX`` from the doxygen
  configurations.
- Disabled FEE driver in the HALCoGen project as it is currently unused.
- Removed the hardware design files from the ``hardware`` directory and
  provided a URL under which the files can be found.

Fixed
=====

- The implementation of ``DIAG_ErrorCurrentOnOpenString()`` had an error where
  the wrong enum has been used leading to an assertion.
- Fixed bug in SOC/SOE counting module that extrapolated for cell voltages
  below lookup-table range
- Fixed bug that caused current sensor scaling values to be only recalibrated
  after startup and not while recalibrating SOC/SOE values via look up tables
  when BMS is at rest.
- A race condition between the SOC and SOE calculation lead to a mutual
  overwriting of the state estimation values.
- Added documentation for the CAN module.
- The regex to parse the ``linkcheck`` output in case of a broken URL did not
  match and raised an exception. The regex is now simpler and has a fallback
  option.
- ``void`` functions used unnecessary ``return;`` at the end of the function.
  These returns have been removed.
- Sometimes ``black`` would fail to write to the cache pickle due to concurrent
  write processes of multiple ``black`` processes. This issue has been fixed by
  passing all files, that should be checked, at once to ``black``.
- Fixed comparison error in SOF module that compared mA with A.
- Some C-language guideline checks did not properly take C language global
  excludes into account.
- Updated links in :numref:`HALCOGEN_TOOL_DOCUMENTATION`.
- Fixed construction of the path variable in batch scripts.
