Minor release of foxBMS 2 (v1.10.0)

This release introduces a CAN-based bootloader, marking a significant step
forward in system flexibility.
The inclusion of the bootloader changes the memory layout of the application,
as the bootloader now precedes the main app.
*Important*: All applications must be rebuilt for compatibility, and the
bootloader must be flashed before deploying updated applications.

A GUI has been added that allows to execute the build tool, loading the
app via the bootloader, and configuring plots.

A Python 'venv' environment is used ('2025-06-pale-fox').
Additional dependencies were updated.
See INSTALLATION.md for information on updating the toolchain.
