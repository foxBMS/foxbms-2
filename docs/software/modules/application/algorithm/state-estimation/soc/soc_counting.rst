Detailed Description
--------------------

By default, |foxbms| uses the internal integrator of the current sensor.
If the current sensor integrator is not available, the integration is made
directly in the |foxbms| software.

The check of the presence of the integrator and the software integration are
made in the :ref:`cc-function-name`.

SE_CalculateStateOfCharge
-------------------------

Charge and Discharge Throughput can be calculated in two ways, depending if an
external analog current counting value is available or not. The algorithm is
implemented as follows:

If analog current counting value is available:

#. Calculate the charge difference between the latest and the previous current
   counting value.
#. Check current flow direction to evaluate if charge/discharge is ongoing.
#. Accumulate either charge or discharge throughput in |soc| database entry.
#. Save time step
#. Save current counting value

If analog current counting value is *NOT* available:

#. Manually integrate current to calculate amount of charge since last call.
#. Check current flow direction to evaluate if charge/discharge is ongoing.
#. Accumulate either charge or discharge throughput in |soc| database entry.
#. Save time step
