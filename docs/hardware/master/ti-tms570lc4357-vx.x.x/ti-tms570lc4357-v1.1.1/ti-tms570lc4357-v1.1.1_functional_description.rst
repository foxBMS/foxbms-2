=========================================================

.. important::

   The MC33FS830A0ES needs to be programmed before the PCB is assembled.
   For more information, see below.

Supply concept
##############

Two MC33FS8530A0ES programmable automotive, functionally safe multi-output
power supply ICs from NXP are used to ensure a safe operation of the hardware.
Each of both SBCs (SBC MCU and SBC Peripheral) needs to be OTP-programmed with
the specific correct setting, so that it can supply the MCU and the peripherals
etc. with the correct voltage as designed (see the Altium files for that).
The details on **how to program** these voltages in the MC33FS830A0ES cannot be
shared due to NDAs. Please get in contact with the manufacturer to get this
information.
However, the **OTP files for programming** can be provided.

You can find the OTP files
`here <https://iisb-foxbms.iisb.fraunhofer.de/foxbms/gen2/hardware/release/>`__.
The OTP files are for all hardware versions provided in the |bms-master|
hardware release.
Additionally, they can for some versions be downloaded directly.

.. note::

   Please ensure to read and understand the information in NOTICE.txt which is
   included in the .zip file.
