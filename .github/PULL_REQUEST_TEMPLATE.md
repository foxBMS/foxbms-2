The foxBMS project is an open source project to empower everybody to build
beyond state of the art battery management systems (BMS) based on software and
hardware that:

- **does not** compromise their outcomes with restricted licenses and
- **does not** create a vendor lock-in.

We therefore release foxBMS with permissive licenses:

- Hardware (layout, schematics) and documentation:
  **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (SPDX short identifier: CC-BY-4.0)**
- Software: **BSD 3-Clause License (SPDX short identifier: BSD-3-Clause)**

For details see the [LICENSE.md](../LICENSE.md) file and the
[license documentation](https://iisb-foxbms.iisb.fraunhofer.de/foxbms/gen2/docs/html/latest/general/licenses.html).

However foxBMS is not openly developed on GitHub (or any other platform). The
main development on this project is done by members of the Fraunhofer IISB and
organized in a non-public repository at the Fraunhofer IISB. This repository is
the output of the release branch of this internal repository.

This workflow allows us to release these development outputs under these
permissive licenses. We do not have a Contributors License Agreement (CLA)
system or similar that would allow us to integrate input from GitHub Pull
Requests, therefore GitHub Pull Requests are currently not accepted.

We would be very pleased if you intend to contribute to this project. Please
contact us first at info@foxbms.org in order to discuss your contribution and
how it can be applied to the project.
