## FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP Library
FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP is a lightweight TCP/IP stack for FreeRTOS. It provides a familiar Berkeley sockets interface, making it as simple to use and learn as possible. FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP's features and RAM footprint are fully scalable, making FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP equally applicable to smaller lower throughput microcontrollers as well as larger higher throughput microprocessors.

This library has undergone static code analysis and checks for compliance with the [MISRA coding standard](https://www.misra.org.uk/). Any deviations from the MISRA C:2012 guidelines are documented under [MISRA Deviations](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP/blob/main/MISRA.md). The library is validated for memory safety and data structure invariance through the [CBMC automated reasoning tool](https://www.cprover.org/cbmc/) for the functions that parse data originating from the network. The library is also protocol tested using Maxwell protocol tester for both IPv4 and IPv6.

**FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP Library V4.2.2
[source code](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP/tree/V4.2.2/source)
is part of the
[FreeRTOS 202406.01 LTS](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-LTS/tree/202406.01-LTS)
release.**

## Getting started
The easiest way to use version 4.0.0 and later of FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP is to refer the Getting started Guide (found [here](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP/blob/main/GettingStarted.md))
Another way is to start with the pre-configured IPv4 Windows Simulator demo (found in [this directory](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/tree/main/FreeRTOS-Plus/Demo/FreeRTOS_Plus_TCP_Minimal_Windows_Simulator)) or IPv6 Multi-endpoint Windows Simulator demo (found in [this directory](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/tree/main/FreeRTOS-Plus/Demo/FreeRTOS_Plus_TCP_IPv6_Demo/IPv6_Multi_WinSim_demo)). That way you will have the correct FreeRTOS source files included, and the correct include paths configured.  Once a demo application is building and executing you can remove the demo application files, and start to add in your own application source files.  See the [FreeRTOS Kernel Quick Start Guide](https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/01-FreeRTOS-quick-start/01-Beginners-guide/02-Quick-start-guide) for detailed instructions and other useful links.

Additionally, for FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP source code organization refer to the [Documentation](http://www.FreeRTOS.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/FreeRTOS_Plus_TCP/TCP_Networking_Tutorial.html), and [API Reference](https://freertos.org/Documentation/03-Libraries/02-FreeRTOS-plus/02-FreeRTOS-plus-TCP/09-API-reference/01-FreeRTOS-plus-TCP-APIs).

### Getting help
If you have any questions or need assistance troubleshooting your FreeRTOS project, we have an active community that can help on the [FreeRTOS Community Support Forum](https://forums.freertos.org). Please also refer to [FAQ](https://www.freertos.org/Why-FreeRTOS/FAQs) for frequently asked questions.

Also see the [Submitting a bugs/feature request](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-bugsfeature-request) section of CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.

**Note:** All the remaining sections are generic and applies to all the versions from V3.0.0 onwards.

## Upgrading to V4.3.0 and above

For users of STM32 network interfaces:

Starting from version V4.3.0, the STM32 network interfaces have been consolidated into a single unified implementation located at `source/portable/NetworkInterface/STM32/NetworkInterface.c`, supporting STM32 F4, F7, and H7 series microcontrollers, with newly added support for STM32 H5. The new interface has been tested with the STM32 HAL Ethernet (ETH) drivers, available at `source/portable/NetworkInterface/STM32/Drivers`. For compatibility, the legacy interfaces (`STM32Fxx` and `STM32Hxx`) have been retained and relocated to `source/portable/NetworkInterface/STM32/Legacy`.


## Upgrading to V3.0.0 and V3.1.0
In version 3.0.0 or 3.1.0, the folder structure of FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP has changed and the files have been broken down into smaller logically separated modules. This change makes the code more modular and conducive to unit-tests. FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP V3.0.0 improves the robustness, security, and modularity of the library. Version 3.0.0 adds comprehensive unit test coverage for all lines and branches of code and has undergone protocol testing, and penetration testing by AWS Security to reduce the exposure to security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the source files have been moved to a `source` directory. This change requires modification of any existing project(s) to include the modified source files and directories.

**FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP V3.1.0 [source code](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP/tree/V3.1.0)(.c .h) is part of the [FreeRTOS 202210.00 LTS](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-LTS/tree/202210.00-LTS) release.**

### Generating pre V3.0.0 folder structure for backward compatibility:
If you wish to continue using a version earlier than V3.0.0 i.e. continue to use your existing source code organization, a script is provided to generate the folder structure similar to [this](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP/tree/f118c8415b4373e3d6e6dbd2d5a116f7eaf27b63).

**Note:** After running the script, while the .c files will have same names as the pre V3.0.0 source, the files in the `include` directory will have different names and the number of files will differ as well. This should, however, not pose any problems to most projects as projects generally include all files in a given directory.

Running the script to generate pre V3.0.0 folder structure:
For running the script, you will need Python version > 3.7. You can download/install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once python is downloaded and installed, you can verify the version from your terminal/command window by typing `python --version`.

To run the script, you should switch to the FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP directory
Then run `python <Path/to/the/script>/GenerateOriginalFiles.py`.

## To consume FreeRTOS+TCP

### Consume with CMake
If using CMake, it is recommended to use this repository using FetchContent.
Add the following into your project's main or a subdirectory's `CMakeLists.txt`:

- Define the source and version/tag you want to use:

```cmake
FetchContent_Declare( freertos_plus_tcp
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP.git
  GIT_TAG        main #Note: Best practice to use specific git-hash or tagged version
  GIT_SUBMODULES "" # Don't grab any submodules since not latest
)
```

- Configure the FreeRTOS-Kernel and make it available
  - this particular example supports a native and cross-compiled build option.

```cmake
# Select the native compile PORT
set( FREERTOS_PLUS_TCP_NETWORK_IF "POSIX" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
# Or: select a cross-compile PORT
if (CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING)
  # Eg. STM32Hxx version of port
  set(FREERTOS_PLUS_TCP_NETWORK_IF "STM32HXX" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
endif()

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(freertos_plus_tcp)
```

### Consuming stand-alone

This repository uses [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to bring in dependent components.

Note: If you download the ZIP file provided by GitHub UI, you will not get the contents of the submodules. (The ZIP file is also not a valid Git repository)
