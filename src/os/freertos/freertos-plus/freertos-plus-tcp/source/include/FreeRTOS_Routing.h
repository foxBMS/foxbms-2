         * pfAddAllowedMAC and pfRemoveAllowedMAC form the network driver's address filtering API.
         * The network stack uses these functions to alter which MAC addresses will be received.
         * The MAC addresses passed to the functions can be unicast or multicast. It is important
         * to note that the stack may call these functions multiple times for the the same MAC address.
         * For example, if two sockets subscribe to the same multicast group, pfAddAllowedMAC()
         * will be called twice with the same MAC address. The network driver is responsible for
         * keeping track of these calls. The network driver should continue receiving that
         * particular MAC address until pfRemoveAllowedMAC() is called the same number of times.
         *
         * Most EMAC hardware nowadays can filter frames based on both specific MAC address matching
         * and hash matching. Specific address matching is ideal because as the name suggests,
         * only frames with the exact MAC address are received. Usually however, the number of
         * specific MAC addresses is limited ( to 4 in many cases ) and is sometimes not enough for
         * all the MAC addresses that the network stack needs to receive.
         * Hash matching is usually based around a 64-bit hash table. For every incoming frame,
         * the EMAC calculates a hash value (mod 64) of the destination MAC address.
         * The hash value is looked up in the 64-bit hash table and if that bit is set, the frame is
         * received. If the bit is clear, the frame is dropped. With hash matching, multiple
         * MAC addresses are represented by a single bit. It is the responsibility of the network
         * driver to manage both the hash address matching and specific address matching capabilities
         * of the EMAC hardware.
         * A quick and dirty implementation option is to receive all MAC addresses and set both
         * pfAddAllowedMAC and pfRemoveAllowedMAC to NULL. This results in an interface running
         * in promiscuous mode and the entire burden of MAC filtering falls on the network stack.
         * For a more realistic implementation, check out
         * "portable/NetworkInterface/DriverSAM/NetworkInterface.c" It demonstrates the use of both
         * specific and hash address matching as well as keeping count of how many time the
         * individual registers/bits have been used. That implementation's init functions also
         * demonstrates the use of prvAddAllowedMACAddress() function to register all end-point's
         * MAC addresses whether the endpoints used the same or different MAC addresses.
