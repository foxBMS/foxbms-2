 * @brief Counting version of #OS_NotifyFromIsr
 *
 * @param xTaskToNotify The handle of the RTOS task being notified, and having its notification value incremented.
 * @param *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken must be initialised to 0.
 *        vTaskNotifyGiveFromISR() will set *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken to pdTRUE if sending the notification caused a
 *        task to unblock, and the unblocked task has a priority higher than the currently running task.
 *        If vTaskNotifyGiveFromISR() sets this value to pdTRUE then a context switch should be requested before the
 *        interrupt is exited.
 *        pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken is an optional parameter and can be set to NULL.
