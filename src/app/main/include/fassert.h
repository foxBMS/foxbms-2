 *
 * @brief   Assert macro implementation
 * @details The default implementation accommodates three behaviors,
 *          based on FAS_ASSERT_LEVEL symbol:
 *
 *          - When the FAS_ASSERT_LEVEL symbol is defined as
 *            FAS_ASSERT_LEVEL_INF_LOOP_AND_DISABLE_INTERRUPTS, the FAS_ASSERT
 *            macro is implemented as an infinite loop in which all interrupts
 *            are disabled. This will definitely trigger a watchdog reset.
 *
 *          - When FAS_ASSERT_LEVEL symbol is defined as
 *            FAS_ASSERT_LEVEL_INF_LOOP_FOR_DEBUG, the validation performed by
 *            the FAS_ASSERT macro is enabled, and a failed validation triggers
 *            an infinite loop. This configuration is recommended for
 *            development environments, as it prevents further execution.
 *            Depending on the configuration this might lead to a watchdog
 *            reset. This mode is intended for investigation of problems by a
 *            developer.
 *
 *          - When FAS_ASSERT_LEVEL symbol is defined as
 *            FAS_ASSERT_LEVEL_NO_OPERATION, the FAS_ASSERT macro is defined as
 *            empty and does nothing. It might be necessary to activate this
 *            mode in resource-constrained situations. Generally it is not
 *            recommended to use this option as it will not notice the
 *            undefined system-states that the assert should catch.
 *
 *          Generally assertions should be used for asserting states and values
 *          that should occur when the program is executed correctly. Do *not*
 *          assert anything that *might* be false. As an example it is
 *          perfectly good practice to assert that the input to a function is
 *          not a null pointer if the function is not designed to accept null
 *          pointers, but it is not good to check if a communication error has
 *          occurred somewhere. Assertions should never trip in a bug-free
 *          program.
 *
 *          Usage is FAS_ASSERT(condition that should be true).
