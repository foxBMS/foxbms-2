 * @brief   Header file of the debug LED driver
 * @details This module controls the debug LED that is directly connected to a
 *          MCU pin. It is used to indicate basic operation states.
 *
 *          * During startup the LED is enabled continuously.
 *          * Once the startup is complete the LED should be called with
 *            #LED_SetToggleTime() in order to indicate whether the BMS has
 *            started normal operation (#LED_NORMAL_OPERATION_ON_OFF_TIME_ms,
 *            slow blinking pattern) or if it is in an error state
 *            (#LED_ERROR_OPERATION_ON_OFF_TIME_ms, fast blinking pattern).
 *          * #LED_SetToggleTime() can be called anytime the indicated pattern
 *            shall change.
