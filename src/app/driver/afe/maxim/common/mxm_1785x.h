 * @details Battery monitoring driver for MAX1785x battery monitoring ICs.
 *
 *          This module supplies a driver for the Battery Monitoring ICs of the
 *          MAX1785x-family by Maxim Integrated.
 *
 *          Entry point for the module is the function #MXM_Tick() in
 *          mxm_afe.c.
 *          It handles the measurement flow and the coordination of the
 *          underlying state-machines.
 *          Below this layer two state-machines are implemented.
 *
 *          The state-machine in mxm_battery_management.c is executed with the
 *          #MXM_5XStateMachine()-function.
 *          This state-machine exposes commands of the Maxim Battery Management
 *          Protocol to the upper layers.
 *          Below, it translates these commands into state-changes for the
 *          underlying state-machine.
 *          This state-machine is implemented in mxm_17841b.c and executed with
 *          #MXM_41BStateMachine().
 *          It handles the register- and buffer-transactions required for the
 *          MAX17841B communication interface (Maxim calls this analog
 *          front-end ASCI).
