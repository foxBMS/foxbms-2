# Vendored Sources and Headers for the NXP MC33775A Driver

This directory contains vendored (i.e. unmodified) source and header files
from NXP ([NXP Semiconductors N.V.](https://www.nxp.com)) which are needed to
build the *Analog Front-End* (AFE)for the NXP MC33775A driver for foxBMS 2.

These files, their content and their formatting (auto-formatting is disabled
for ``clang-format``, see the ``.clang-format`` file in this directory) should
not be modified within in the foxBMS 2 project.
