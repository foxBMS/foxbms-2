 * @brief   PWM driver for the TMS570LC43xx.
 * @details This module uses the PWM hardware of the MCU in order to generate
 *          a PWM signal. Currently, the implementation uses only the ePWM
 *          (not the HET) and supports only setting a duty cycle (in percent).
 *          For the module to work currently, the function etpwmInit() has to
 *          be called before using API of this module.
