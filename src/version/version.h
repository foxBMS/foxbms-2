 *          toolchain
 * @details Defines the structure and type of information that is stored in the
 *          version configuration variable.
 *          The version is extracted from git (if the project is developed
 *          within a git repository) by the build toolchain.
 *          If the project is not developed in a git repository, the version
 *          information indicates this.
